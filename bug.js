This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a callback function that attempts to modify the component's state directly.  Because state updates in React are asynchronous, the callback function might not have access to the latest state values, leading to unexpected behavior or stale closures. Consider this example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // Correct approach
      // setCount(count + 1); // Incorrect approach: Stale closure
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return <Text>Count: {count}</Text>;
};
```

The incorrect approach (`setCount(count + 1)`) will often lead to the counter incrementing by more than one per second due to the asynchronous nature of `setCount`.  The correct approach uses the functional update form (`setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)`) which ensures the update uses the latest `count` value.
